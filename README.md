Let's play a game... https://truix12.github.io/diceGame/

Two-player dice game. The objective for victory is to reach 100 points. You roll the die, and if you roll a 1, there is a player change, and you lose the points you've accumulated. If you roll a number from 2 to 6, you gain the sum of the points you rolled. To add these points to your score, you must use the 'Save' button. The 'Save' button also switches the player who rolls the die. Have fun! 🎲🏆😉
